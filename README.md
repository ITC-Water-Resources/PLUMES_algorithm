# PLUMES algorithm

Matlab code for turbid plume detection

This function provides a package of Matlab functions to detected turbid plumes remote sensing reflectance produtcs or model outputs. This is likely not the fastest implementation possible for the PLUMES algorithm. However, it is easy to use and handles the processing of hih resolution satellite scenes such as Landsat-8, -9 and Sentinel-2.

#### The function PLUMES_algorithm.m is described in Tavora et al., 2023 (DOI 10.3389/fmars.2023.1215327)

# Questions and Suggestions

For questions regarding the script implementation or to suggest changes to improve its functionality, please contact Juliana Tavora at tavora.pereira@gmail.com or j.tavora@utwente.nl

#### Examples/ folder will be updated as soon as the dataset used in the paper receives a DOI.
